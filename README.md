# ALX System Engineering and DevOps - Bash, Scripting, Web Stack/Web Stack Debugging, Networking & Security, CI/CD

This repository contains programs written for the system engineering and DevOps
track at ALX Holberton School. In these projects, I worked with Bash and practiced
writing Bash scripts to automate tasks. I learned about the OSI model and
various Linux networking tools. Further, I configured a distributed system -
two web servers and one load balancer - for deployment of my AirBnB project
using Nginx, HAProxy, certbot, ufw, and MySQL. The specific list of projects
contained follows:

* [0x00. Shell, basics](./0x00-shell_basics)
* [0x01. Shell, permissions](./0x01-shell_permissions)
